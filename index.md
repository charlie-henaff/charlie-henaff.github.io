An intervention management software for commercial use that allows you to create, plan, report and invoice interventions.

This software contains a react front dedicated to management, an android front dedicated to technicians and an api open to customers made with api-platform.

All our clients are manageable by another api named glados which is interfaced with the mageltys one. This second more global api allow us to redirect api calls to proper customers databases, send mail or sms and store customers api use stats.

*i worked both on apis and android app*

A new intranet for Sygmatel, the creation of an activity time management software (only for internal use) and other small intranet apps. 

This new time management application allow our employees to declare and control the time spent on different business codes before an automatic send to our erp software.

This new intranet has a frontend in react, a backend in api-platform and an android application.  

It interacts with internal software such as Lucca (employee management software), Cegid (erp) or Windows Active Directory thanks to talend data integration scripts.

*i proposed the stack, and worked on every part of it*
